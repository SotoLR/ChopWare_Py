## FAQ

Q: What is diceware?

A: See http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html



Q: Is this safe?

A: See http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html



Q: Should you really be publishing the wordlist you use?

A: Diceware -> dice -> dicing -> chopping -> chopware.... Hey, it's more creative than "PassSelector" or something
